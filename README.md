# ERC721F

The goal of ERC721F is to provide a simple extension of IERC721 with significant gas savings for minting multiple and single NFTs in a single transaction. This project and implementation will be updated regularly and will continue to stay up to date with best practices.

ERC721F Extends ERC721 Non-Fungible Token Standard basic implementation. No longer uses ERC721Enumerable , but still provide a totalSupply() and walletOfOwner(address _owner) implementation.

The Author is not liable for any outcomes as a result of using ERC721F. DYOR.
